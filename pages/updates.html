            <h1 class="updates_title">STARSHIP FLIGHT TEST 1</h1>

            <p class="updates_text">Starship's first inaugural flight test has completed a number of objectives as SpaceX continues to advance the capabilities of the Starship system.</p>

            <p class="updates_text">On March 17, 2024, Starship has successfully lifted off from Starbase in Texas. All 33 Raptor engines on the Super Heavy Booster started up successfully and for 
            the first time, completed a full duration Super Heavy burn. Starship then executed a successful hot-stage separation and continued on its way to space. </p>

            <p class="updates_text">Follow stage separation, Super Heavy initiated its boostback burn sequence, which sends signal to reignite 10 of the Raptor engines. At the same time, Starship 24
            was signalled to start up its 3 Sea Level Raptor engines, the teams find the most likely cause of this due to some type of physics lag happening at that time which only affected the
            Ship as the ingame camera was focused on the Super Heavy Booster. Future flights will utilize a same engine controller as Super Heavy uses for ignition of Ship engines. If the Ship
            would enter a same scenario as Ship 24, the Automatic Flight Safety System will count it as a flight rules violation and would trigger the termination of Ship.</p>

            <p class="updates_text">Super Heavy Booster initiated its retrograde maneuver turn and entered an uncontrollable spin for a brief period of time. SpaceX team for future flights
            has decided to gradually increase Super Heavy's thrust on turn and at the same time, the 10 Inner ring of Raptors will be ignited half-way through the flip as opposed to before the flip.
            Super Heavy's aerodynamic grid fins would also be prepared for flip before the flip starts as opposed to after the flip.    
            </p>

            <p class="updates_text">As the Boostback completed, Super Heavy reoriented for its atmospheric re-entry. Future flights would utilize a more staggered sequence of Boostback shutdown for
            increased target accuracy post-boostback burn. Future flights would also not rely on in-built reaction wheels and instead purely utilize Raptor TVC and Attitude Control Systems.    
            </p>

            <p class="updates_text">Just before Super Heavy landing burn, Starship entered terminal guidance and roughly 10 seconds later, Starship's computer turned off as it would do in a 
            completed burn. Same as last time, due to possible physics lag, Starship did not initiate its planned Raptor shutdown and instead kept going, and at the same time, AFSS detected a flight
            rule violation and the Ship was terminated. Another upgrade from Flight 1 to Flight 2 on Super Heavy booster which would be utilized at this time in flight is a dogleg maneuver to reduce
            its vertical speed and maximize landing burn efficiency. Super Heavy Booster 9 will ignite its 13 Raptor Engines at roughly 1.5km in altitude as opposed to Booster 7 which ignited at 8km.</p>

            <p class="updates_text">Super Heavy reignited 13 of its 33 Raptor Engines for landing burn, coming down at approximately 800 m/s, faster than anticipated. As Super Heavy was supposed to 
            do its switchover to only the 3 Center Raptor Engines at roughly 150 m/s and roughly 1300 meters above the sea, the software entered a neutral state and did not complete the remainder 
            of the planned landing burn. The issue was found to be a Super Heavy recovery modes switchover failure and has been solvled during the investigation.</p>

            <p class="updates_text">Future flights also utilize a more in depth data packet that Starship control receives every 10km from the vehicle. This data packet log helps with information 
            regarding vehicle positioning, altitude, velocity, deltav and more. 
            </p>

            <p class="updates_text">SpaceX at this time is currently preparing Booster 9 and Starship 26 to fly on Flight 2, with Starship 26 currently being prepared to undergo several static fire 
            tests and flight simulations runs.</p>

            <p class="updates_text">The primary objective for Flight 2 is to reach a fully circular orbit of 200km by 200km and to perform a de-orbit burn after 2 full orbits around Earth. As 
            secondary objectives, SpaceX team hopes that we will be able to do a payload test deployment simulation and a hopefully node maneuver test as we would need to do for flights to Moon and Mars.
